Add:
	bitwise operators
	let $0, $1, ... be used to access block arguments? or no?
	allow blocks like if statements to not make a new scope
	add += and related operators
		++ and --?
	allow for cool floats w/ scientific notation and stuff
	add comments
	check if my order of operations and associativity are correct?
	make a SoAndSoLiteralConverable method thing, like swift
	fix `rake spec`
	add the ternery operator
	add more control flow
	add enums
	add an import keyword
		include a standard library
	add errors for:
		wrong arity
		unknown vars
	add more helpful comments and documentation
	try this/see if it's necessary?: http://stackoverflow.com/a/10851447/1525759
	add arrays and hashes
	plan out/improve syntax
	rename Boolean to Bool, and Integer to Int

Soon:
	add errors
	have non-binary operators use MyLangCore.find_op
		allow definition of non-binary operators 
	recognize types as constants/vars so it'll recognize user defined types
