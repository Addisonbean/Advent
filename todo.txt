Add:
	bitwise operators
	fix escape sequences in strings (look at day8_pt1.rb)
	let $0, $1, ... be used to access block arguments? or no?
	allow blocks like if statements to not make a new scope
	add += and related operators
		++ and --?
	allow for cool floats w/ scientific notation and stuff
	add comments
	check if my order of operations and associativity are correct?
	make a SoAndSoLiteralConverable method thing, like swift
	fix `rake spec`
	add the ternary operator
	add more control flow
	add enums
	add an import keyword
		include a standard library
	add errors for:
		wrong arity
		unknown vars
	add more helpful comments and documentation
	try this/see if it's necessary?: http://stackoverflow.com/a/10851447/1525759
	add arrays and hashes
	plan out/improve syntax
	rename Boolean to Bool, and Integer to Int
	make a vim plugin for the language
	extensively check for possible errors/crashes
	add a Gemfile so you can do "bundle install" and crap
	add puncuation to errors in the call to raise or the definition of raise?
	don't assign the special `_` variable
	write tests for bin/advent
	use heredocs in tests
	add a readme, and a file on contributing that explains stuff like `# DANGEROUS` and why tabs are superior to spaces

Soon:
	add methods
	raise an error when calling a value that's not a function/method
	print the return values as they would be represented in Advent, not Ruby (half complete, requires classes)
	the todolist in bin/advent
	add constants so you can't redefine classes and stuff

	have non-binary operators use AdventCore.find_op
		allow definition of non-binary operators 
	recognize types as constants/vars so it'll recognize user defined types
		define/store classes in Advent so they don't carry over to other instances of Advent
	when using && and || don't check the second arg if it won't matter
